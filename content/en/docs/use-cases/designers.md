To increase the durability of the USB Nugget, we continue to develop a series of 3D printed cases to protect Nuggets from accidental damage.  
<br />
You can find the files to print, modify, or remix our case designs in the [case section of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/HakCat-Tech/Nugget-Cases).
